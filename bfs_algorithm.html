                <p>The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm effectively solves mazes by flooding white-space until every pixel in the maze is connected. This requires the transformation of the image into a graph of nodes and a minimum path algorithm to solve the maze once it is connected. This method will always reveal the best solution to the maze if multiple solution paths exist.

                <h3>Algorithm Implementation</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Our BFS algorithm was designed to work on any purely black and white images. This function was written in Matlab with java elements imported to use linked list nodes as a means of a queue-based data structure. The BFS algorithm worked by taking in 3 required inputs (start position, end position, and the maze image) and 2 optional parameters for gif generation. The start and end positions of the image were determined during pre-processing and stored in 2x1 coordinate vectors. The algorithm begins by ‘flooding’ the whitespace of the image with weighted values, starting at the start coordinate of the maze.  This flooding affect can be seen in the "GIF Generation" setion below.
                <br>
                <br>
                To properly implement the BFS, pixels were individually serviced and marked with a weight, then surrounding pixels (up, down, right, and left) were added to a queue with an accumulating weight attached. This strategy for solving allows multiple paths to be serviced simultaneously if there is ever a point in the maze where paths diverge. Once there are no more pixels in the queue unvisited, or a pixel in the queue has the same coordinates as the end position, the algorithm will break and return the weighted flood of the image. From here a simple back-tracing algorithm is implemented starting at the end pixel – A path is highlighted with the lowest valued pixels touching one another until a lowest weight point is reached (this is always the start).

                The maze below on the left is from the original maze that we used FINISH. The maze in the middle is the line expansion FINISH. The maze on the right is the shortest path FINISH.

                <p>Flood fill BFS is an effective strategy for finding the shortest path in a matrix mapped image. Although by nature its solving strategy may take a little longer than other methods, such as adjacency matrices, it is a great approach for solving non-linear mazes and always finding the shortest path possible if multiple solution paths exist.</p>

                In order to further our investigation of the BFS algorithm and expand our knowledge, we decided to create GIFs of how the BFS algorithm traverses a maze in order to find the solution. Once we were successful in creating a GIF using our original maze that we started with, we then tried our GIF generation on a much smaller maze, and also a maze with very thick edges.  We were successful in the creation of all of these GIFs, which can be seen below.

                Clearly demonstrated by the gifs, compression methods done in preprocessing can substantially optimize the computation time of the BFS algorithm. Most notably of this is of course the sampled compression that shrinks both the black and white lines of the image to a maximum width of 2 while still maintaining all key information in the image. In fact, the sampled compressed maze BFS runs 61 times faster than that of the original cropped image. While there are still many ways to approach a solution path for the maze image, it is apparent in these exams that preprocessing done on them can greatly optimize the runtime of our solution algorithms.
