            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>The intuition behind the A<sup>*</sup> Search Algorithm is to approximate the shortest path within a set of pixels by calculating the least cost path.  This algorithm takes the distance between the current pixel and starting pixel of a maze as one cost (<i>G</i>), and the approximate distance between the current pixel and the ending pixel as the second cost, or the "heuristic" (<i>H</i>).  Based on the sum of these costs for each pixel, which we denote as <i>F</i>, this algorithm places each pixel in one of two lists throughout the program: the "closed list" that consists of all pixels whose neighbors have been searched, and the "open list" that consists of all pixels whose neighbors have yet to be searched.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Although there are many ways to calculate the heuristic within an A<sup>*</sup> search, the equation we chose to use is known as the "Diagonal Distance." We chose this equation because it accounts for diagonal movement, which we allowed in our algorithm.  The equation for <i>H</i> is as follows:

                <br>
                In the above equation, the function calculates the heuristic for one <i>node</i>, or pixel. <i>node.x</i> represents the column that the current pixel sits in, while <i>goal.x</i> represents the column that the end pixel lies in. Likewise, <i>node.y</i> and <i>goal.y</i> represent the rows in which both the current pixel and the end pixel are located. The variable <i>D</i> represents the cost of moving horizontally or vertically, while the variable <i>D2</i> represents the cost of moving diagonal.  To keep things simple, we set both <i>D</i> and <i>D2</i> equal to 1, which is known as the "Chebyshev Distance."</p>

                <h3>Algorithm Implementation</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Alike our BFS algorithm, our A<sup>*</sup> search was designed to work on any purely black and white images. This function was written in Matlab using structs to represent each pixel and matrices to represent both the closed and open lists. The A<sup>*</sup> algorithm worked by taking in 3 required inputs (start position, end position, and the maze image) and 2 optional parameters for gif generation. The start and end positions of the image were determined during pre-processing and stored in 2x1 coordinate vectors. The algorithm begins by starting at the beginning pixel and moving on based on the costs of the available neighbors to the starting pixel and subsequent current pixels.
                <br>
                <br>
                To properly implement the A<sup>*</sup> search algorithm, the cost of each pixel that was a neighbor to a current pixel was individually calculated and put in the open list if it's <i>F</i> value was the least of all pixels in the open list.  The surrounding pixels (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest) were then added to the open list with an accumulating cost attached if they were not in the closed list and were not an edge. As soon as the current pixel's neighbors were all checked, the current pixel was placed into the closed list and the algorithm repeated.  This strategy for solving allowed multiple paths to be calculated simultaneously if there was ever a point in the maze where paths diverge. Once the ending pixel was found (the current pixel = end pixel) the algorithm would end and return the weighted flood of the image. From there a simple back-tracing algorithm was implemented starting at the end pixel and going backwards based on the parent of each pixel. A path was then highlighted with the approximate lowest valued pixels touching one another until the starting pixel was reached. An example of what this algorithm looks like when run on a generic maze can be seen below.

                <br>
                <p>While the A<sup>*</sup> search algorithm does not guarantee that it will find the shortest path in a maze, our algorithm is advantageous because it approximates a shortest path, so having a compressed maze wouldn't be absolutely necessary. A compressed maze would be helpful for runtime, but A<sup>*</sup> is designed to avoid this.</p>

                <p> 
                Once we had implemented the GIF generation with the BFS algoirthm, we wanted to do the same with the A<sup>*</sup> search algorithm.  Although we were only able to test this GIF generation with one maze (due to time), we were successful in doing so. As will be mentioned later, the GIF runs fairly slowly because the algorithm that we wrote was not fully optimized.  This GIF could be sped up in the future with a more efficient implementation of the A<sup>*</sup> search algorithm.
